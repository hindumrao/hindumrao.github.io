# The Problem
Many studies have linked proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use to several adverse effects including Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea, community-acquired pneumonia, bone fractures, and nutritional deficiencies.1 Other reports have linked PPI use with chronic kidney disease, cognitive decline, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and even death.1,2,3 Many patients take PPIs chronically and may be concerned about the risk of these side effects. This poses a challenge for healthcare providers as safety data has been primarily based on retrospective and observational studies. Thus, the fears associated with long term PPI therapy can create confusion, result in extended patient visits, and lead to under-prescribing PPIs in circumstances when their use is appropriate.
