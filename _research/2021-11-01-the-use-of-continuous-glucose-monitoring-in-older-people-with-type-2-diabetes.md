# Abstract

## Objective
To review current guidelines and literature regarding continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) use in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in older people.

## Data Sources
A PubMed search of articles published through August 2020 using a combination of the following: older people, T2DM, continuous glucose monitoring, hypoglycemia, and hyperglycemia.

## Study Selection/Data Extraction
Relevant randomized control trials, meta-analyses, and guidelines were assessed for the use of CGM in older patients with T2DM. Articles were included based on relevance to the topic, detailed methods, and complete results.

## Data Synthesis
CGM use in T2DM management in older people is not well defined. CGM may be a valuable technology in older people who face unique challenges, such as hypoglycemia, decline in cognitive function, and variable glucose levels. This article provides a review of recommendations for glucose monitoring in T2DM and discusses the role of specific CGM products.

## Conclusion
CGM is a viable option for older people with T2DM to help improve overall diabetes control. Pharmacists can play an important role in educating patients about this technology.
