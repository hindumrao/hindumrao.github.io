# Abstract 
Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are well established as effective treatment options for patients with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and concomitant heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). However, recent research suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors can reduce the incidence of cardiovascular death and heart failure hospitalizations in patients with HFrEF, even without T2DM. This evidence points to an emerging indication for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in HFrEF management.
