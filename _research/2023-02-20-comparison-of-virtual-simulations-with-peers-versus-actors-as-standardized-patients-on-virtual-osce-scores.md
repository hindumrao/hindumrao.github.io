# Abstract 

## Objective
This study's primary aim is to assess the use of different types of standardized patients (SPs) during formative simulation activities on summative objective structured clinical exams (OSCE) in a PharmD curriculum.

## Methods
Randomized-controlled study with first-year pharmacy students in a Pharmacist Patient Care Lab (PCL) course. Students were randomized into groups with either hired actors or their peers as SPs for virtual simulation activities. All students then completed a virtual teaching OSCE (TOSCE) and virtual OSCE. A mixed effects analysis was done to compare TOSCE and OSCE scores between the two groups.

## Results
There were no significant differences between the two groups in their TOSCE or OSCE scores for the analytical and global rubrics.

## Conclusion
This study demonstrates that peers may be as effective as having hired actors as SPs in preparing students for virtual skills exams.
