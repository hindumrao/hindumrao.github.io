# Abstract

Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a disorder in which a heart valve is damaged or diseased, resulting in poor cardiac blood flow. Types of VHD include aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation, and tricuspid regurgitation. Most patients with VHD require surgery to repair or replace the valve and subsequent antithrombotic therapy to prevent clotting. Antithrombotic therapy options that are commonly used after valve replacement or repair are vitamin K antagonists, such as warfarin, and antiplatelet agents, such as aspirin. Patient counseling points should include drug-drug or drug-food interactions, frequency of international normalized ratio monitoring with warfarin, and signs and symptoms of bleeding. Pharmacists are in an ideal position to partake in the management and care of patients with VHD.
